        <item>Cake placeholder text. A cake is a thing that is baked and you eat and is sweet and stuff.
        There are several different types of cakes and this is one of them. Cakes are generally used for parties but you can eat them whenever.</item>
        <item>Ice-Cream is another sweet thing, but this one is fairly cold. It is often super expensive here in Van but they are generally really good.
        I want to get some ice cream now :(</item>
        <item>Pancakes are cakes that you make in a pan (maybe). Running out of stuff to write by this point but this is much more fun than just copying stuff.
        Alright enough about pancakes now.</item>
        <item>Sandwich is not in fact a mythological creature (witch) that controls sand, but rather a salty food thing that has things between two breads.
        Fore some inexplicable reason it invites many ridiculous debates as to what is and is not categorized as a sandwich</item>

        <item>The Dry Ingredients
Flour: Use all-purpose flour or whole wheat. A combination of the both is nice, too.
Sugar: We use granulated sugar, but you could experiment with brown sugar. Brown sugar will make the pancakes a little moister.
Baking Powder: Baking powder makes the pancakes so light and fluffy.
Salt: We like to use 3/4 teaspoon of coarse salt (or 1/2 teaspoon of fine salt). It balances the sugar nicely and brings out lots of flavor in the pancakes. If you are using salted butter, you may want to reduce this.</item>
